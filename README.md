## DigiClassroom
A Classroom service, MVC based web application built to replicate the working of [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/).

## Motivation

This project was built to fulfil a termwork project assignment in the course "Web Development in .NET". Amidst the raging pandemic, google classroom was all the rage, I thought it would be interesting to implement something simple yet extremely useful like it to get the feel of the framework!

## Framework and Tech:

- .NET core 3.1
- IDE: Visual Studio -.-

## Features

Pretty much everything you'd also find in Google Classroom like:

- Create Classroom
- Create a post
- Create an assignment
- Submit and assignment
- Invite people

...yada, yada, yada. Nothing out of the blue 

**Except...**

While enabling anchors to links in posts and assignments, I accidentally enabled HTML support for all the textareas, which now allows a user to use any textarea as a playground for HTML, CSS and also Bootstrap. 

As amazing as I think it is, this is a bug. Anyone can write literally all the css they can muster up, can mess up selectors and wreck the front end. They can change the look of the whole webpage, to the point it may not even work! Still, it's pretty interesting, so I let this bug exist, might even come around to a solution.
